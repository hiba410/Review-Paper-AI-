# 🎮 Automated Anti-Cheat Systems in Online Games: ML vs Rule-Based Detection

This repository contains the **review paper** titled:  
**“Automated Anti-Cheat Systems: Machine Learning vs Rule-Based Detection in Online Games.”**  

The paper explores how **cheating in online games** threatens fair play and game integrity, and compares two major approaches to automated cheat detection: **Rule-Based Systems** and **Machine Learning (ML)-based Systems**.

## 📖 Abstract
Cheating in online games has become a major challenge for developers, affecting both **player experience** and **game revenue**. Automated anti-cheat systems are critical in detecting and preventing such activities.  

This review provides a comparative analysis of:  
- **Rule-Based Systems** – Traditional methods that rely on predefined rules, heuristics, and signature-based detection.  
- **Machine Learning Systems** – Advanced methods that learn from player behavior and adapt to evolving cheating techniques.  

The paper examines the **advantages, limitations, and effectiveness** of each approach, highlighting how **ML offers adaptability** while **rule-based systems provide simplicity and transparency**.  
A hybrid approach combining both methods is also discussed as a future direction for robust cheat prevention.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Review the **state of automated anti-cheat systems** in online gaming.  
- Compare **rule-based vs machine learning** approaches.  
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and common challenges of each.  
- Suggest **future improvements** and the potential of **hybrid models**.  

---

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- Overview of **cheating techniques** in online games (aimbots, wallhacks, scripting, etc.)  
- **Rule-Based Detection:** simplicity, low cost, but limited adaptability.  
- **Machine Learning Detection:** behavioral analysis, adaptability, but higher complexity.  
- **Performance comparison** between the two approaches.  
- **Hybrid anti-cheat frameworks** as a balanced solution.  

---

## 📊 Findings
- Rule-based systems are effective for **known cheats** but fail against **evolving threats**.  
- ML systems adapt better to **dynamic cheating behaviors**, but may suffer from **false positives** and require large datasets.  
- A **hybrid model** combining both approaches could maximize detection accuracy while minimizing system weaknesses.
